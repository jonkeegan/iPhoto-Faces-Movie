#iPhoto-Faces-Movie

Make a movie of all the faces in your iPhoto library

This script will grab all of the faces that iPhoto has found
in your photos for a given year and glob them all together into a movie. 
This grabs ALL faces, not just the ones you have named. So you may get 
strangers in the backgrounds, statues, news anchors on the TV in the 
background etc. It's a pretty intense way to review a year of your life in photos.
